### Problem Statement and Key Objective

<b> Context </b>
***In Progress***

One of the more understated parts of today's basketball game is passing. Passing is such an integral part of the game and itâ€™s what makes the game so beautiful to watch. Notorious offensive schemes, such as Chicago Bulls/Los Angeles Lakers' Triangle Offense, Spurs's elecentric ball movement, and the Warriors offensive system has made many strides in building many powerhouse franchises that resulted in championships. 



<b> Key Objective </b>
- Rank Players based on Past Historical Boxscores, Team Record (for stability), salary (more $, more years left on contract means more overall minutes), and Injury History
- Apply selective Z-scoring to the top 200 players from the previous year.
- Adjust all the Percentage Weights (FG%, FT%, and 3PT%) based on volume
